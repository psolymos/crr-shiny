# Processing

- save raster as integer for summaries in native crs (TM10)
- save an RGB version as well (~2x the size) for display in web mercator format

TODO:

- create a new version of the app
- describe the api:
  - how to organize files
  - how to update the layer database (csv)

The app will build the controls from the csv
Create the map using the RGB
Calculate summaries based on the INT

Note: pixel counts by NSR and adding NSR boundary overlay might not be ready
